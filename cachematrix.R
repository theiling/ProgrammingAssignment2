## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do
## Below are two functions that are used to create a special object that stores a 
## matrix  and cache's its inverse.

## Write a short comment describing this function
## The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special "vector", which is really a list containing a function to
## set the value of the matrix
## get the value of the matrix
## set the value of the inverse
## get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m<-NULL
  set<-function(y){
    x<<-y
    m<<-NULL
  }
  get<-function() x
  setinverse<-function(solve) m<<- solve
  getinverse<-function() m
  list(set=set, get=get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}

## Write a short comment describing this function
## The following function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix" 
## created with the above function. However, it first checks to see if it
## has already been calculated. 
## If so, it gets the matrix inverse from the cache and skips the computation.
## Otherwise, it calculates the inverse from the data and sets the value of the
## inverse in the cache via the setinverse function.


cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m<-x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(m)){
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m<-solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(m)
  m
}
